# DCUnited
  When the semester began we met with D.C. United’s Director of Soccer Strategy and Analysis, Stewart Mairs. The question we are looking to solve revolves around D.C. United’s 2018 MLS season and the opening of their new stadium.
  
	Our task is to aid in determining what results D.C. United should expect after their start of the 2018 MLS season as a road team, as well as make recommendations of how the impact can be mitigated. As a case of a team that has faced similar circumstances in the past, we were asked to consider Toronto FC and the start of their 2015 and 2016 seasons.
  
  To start us off, we were given a datasets that were acquired from OPTA. OPTA is a world leader in sports analytics data that provides data for 30 sports throughout 70 countries. The data we received ranged from the 2015-2017 MLS season; it included player and team performance. We were also given data gathered by D.C. United which included team travel schedules for the 2015, 2016, and 2017 seasons, as well as GPS player data for from the 2017 D.C. United season.
